## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

# Hi! üëãüèº
## This is my project submission for [MII](https://juicebox.co.id/)

A simple mobile screen layout.

Take a look of it. And if you wanna play around with this simple overview, then you can use my repo and run the development server:

## Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd juicebox-test
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Resources

I uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [NextJS Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - NextJS Features, Documentation, and API.
