# Hi! 👋🏼
## This is my project submission for [Juicebox](https://juicebox.co.id/)

A simple mobile screen layout.

Take a look of it. And if you wanna play around with this simple overview, then you can use my repo and run the development server:

## Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd juicebox-test
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Resources

I uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [NextJS Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - NextJS Features, Documentation, and API.
